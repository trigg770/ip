/**
 * Entry point of the Ted chatbot.
 * Ted stores todos, deadlines and events, lists the stored tasks on request,
 * and can mark, unmark and delete them, until the user enters {@code bye}.
 * <p>
 * The same conversation is offered two ways: {@link #run()} drives it from the
 * terminal, while {@link #getResponse(String)} answers one message at a time so
 * that the GUI can drive it instead. Both share the work below.
 * <p>
 * This class only wires the parts together and runs the conversation loop: the
 * talking belongs to {@link Ui}, the tasks to {@link TaskList}, the save file
 * to {@link Storage}, reading the user's words to {@link Parser}, and the work
 * itself to the {@link Command} classes.
